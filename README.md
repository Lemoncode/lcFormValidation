# lcFormValidation Library ![build status](https://travis-ci.org/Lemoncode/lcFormValidation.svg?branch=master "Build Status")

lcFormValidation is a form library validation:

* Heavily based on JavaScript (no html attributes annotations).
* Full async, all validations are processed as async.

lc-FormValidation is third party / framework agnostic, although it will integrate quite well with libraries like React / Redux.

# Why another form library? #

Form validation is a complex issue, usually we can find solutions that cover the simple scenarios and are focused on building RAD development just by adding some attributes / annotations to given fields or HTML fields (e.g. input), the disadvantage that we have found to this approach:

* There are different approaches for each scenario: sometimes you have to add some tweaking for async validations, some other take care of special scenarios (like validations that depends on more than one field).

* Usually you can easily unit test one validation (directive / annotation), but testing the whole form is a complex task (directives are coupled to e.g. HTML).

* Validations are tightly coupled to e.g. directives or markup is not easy to reuse this validation code in e.g. server side (universal javascript).

# Approach #

In a form validation we can find features / code that can be placed in a base class (baseFormValidation):

* ValidateField: Validates a single field (e.g. call this when controls content change or the control looses the focus).
* ValidateForm: Validates the whole form (all fields, plus global validations).


Then we can inherit from that base class and define our own specific form validations:

* Add in the constructor of the inherited class the mappings between form field Id's and form and entity field Id, plus defining the validations per field to be executed.

The idea is to encapsulate all the common functionality in a base class, and create independent classes that will inherit from this base class to implement the validation of each individual form.

![validation class diagram](./ReadmeResources/validation.png "validation class diagram")

By following this approach:

* We encapsulate all the generic validation plumbing in a base class.
* We can implement real world form validation in the specific classes.
* We can benefit from external validation libraries (validate emails, url, iban ...), wihtout having to implement additional scaffolding (e.g. create a directive for this validation).
* We can easily test (plain javascript framework agnostic):
    * The formValidationBase.
    * Each specific form validation class.
    * The generic validator helpers.
* We can just run this javascript code in the client and serverside (e.g. node solution) ** (NOTE) We expect to create a sample showing how this could be implemented soon.


# FormBaseValidation + Sample Form #

FormBaseValidation implementation (already implemented by the library):


```
export class BaseFormValidation {
    _validationEngine: IValidationEngine;

    constructor() {
        this._validationEngine = new ValidationEngine();
    }

    public validateField(vm: any, key: string, value: any, filter : any = consts.defaultFilter): Promise<FieldValidationResult> {
        return this._validationEngine.triggerFieldValidation(vm, key, value, filter);
    }

    public validateForm(vm: any): Promise<FormValidationResult> {
        return this._validationEngine.validateFullForm(vm);
    }
}
```

Let's say we want to add validation support for a login form (validations to be performed: name field is required).

Login form validation implementation


```
  public constructor() {
      super();

      this._validationEngine.initialize([
          {formFieldName: 'fullname', vmFieldName: 'fullname'},
          {formFieldName: 'password', vmFieldName: 'password'}
      ]);

      this._validationEngine.addValidationRuleToField('fullname',
                                            (vm, value) : Promise<FieldValidationResult> => {
                                                // Required field
                                                let isFieldInformed : boolean = (value && value.length > 0);
                                                // We could use string ID's if multilanguage is required
                                                let errorInfo : string = (isFieldInformed) ? "" : "Mandatory field";

                                                const validationResult : FieldValidationResult = new FieldValidationResult();
                                                validationResult.type = "REQUIRED";
                                                validationResult.succeeded = isFieldInformed;
                                                validationResult.errorMessage = errorInfo;

                                                return Promise.resolve(validationResult);
                                            }
                                            )
  }
}

```


# How to run a sample #

To install the stable version:

```
npm install --save lc-form-validation
```

This assumes you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as your package manager.  
If you donâ€™t, you can [access these files on unpkg](https://unpkg.com/lc-form-validation/), download them, or point your package manager to them.

Prerequisites: In order to get these examples up and running you will have to get installed typings and webpack node modules globally.

```
npm install typings -g
```

If you want to start from the source code, follow this steps:

First download the source code from Git.

* Navigate to the lib folder (Note: this process will be less painful and added to preinstall when the following [bug](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10379) gets fixed on npm.

* Execute npm install

```
lcFormValidation\lib> npm install
```

* Execute build

```
lcFormValidation\lib> npm run build
```

* Navigate to one the samples folders, e.g. "samples/react/00 Simple Form".

```
lcFormValidation> cd "samples/react/00 SimpleForm"
```

* Execute npm install (this is connected to the local lib folder).

```
lcFormValidation\lib\samples\react\00 SimpleForm> npm install
```

* Execute npm start

```
lcFormValidation\lib\samples\react\00 SimpleForm> npm start
```

* Open your favourite browser and navigate to http://localhost/8080

If you want to run the unit tests that are located under the lib folder from the command line you will need to install karma-cli globally (npm install karma-cli -g), in order to run them, type from your command line "karma start".

# Samples forms implemented #

Samples running with React + Redux:
* Basic login.
* Signup form (including async validation against GitHub user api).
* Quiz form.

We are looking for contributors to implement samples and support for libraries such as Angularjs, Ember... if you would like to cooperate don't hesitate contacting us.

# Future Enhancements #

* Allow connecting with array fields / table like scenario.
* Allow this to be easily be used outside the context of a web form (e.g. rest api server side)
